Everything same as [HumbleNewTabPage](https://github.com/ibillingsley/HumbleNewTabPage), I just forked it to add a greeting text on the screen.

The font used is [Inconsolota](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata). (You can change it to you liking)

You can change the name of the user getting greeted by editing the newtab.html file in Line 10.
You can change the font-family, font size and the position of text by editing the group, #greeting starting from Line 305.
