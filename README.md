Everything is same as the original [HumbleNewTabPage](https://github.com/ibillingsley/HumbleNewTabPage), I just forked it to add a greeting text on the screen.

The font I used is [Inconsolota](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata).

You can change the greeting text to any text by editing the Line 10 of the newtab.html file.

You can change the font-family, font size, color and the position of text by editing the group, #greeting starting from Line 305 of the newtab.html file.

Special thanks to ChatGPT.
